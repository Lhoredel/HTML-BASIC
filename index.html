    <h1>My Understanding of the Lesson: Introduction to Web Development</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The lesson “Introduction to Web Development” helped me understand what web development truly means and why it is important in the world today. 
        Web development refers to the process of creating websites and web applications that people use every single day, such as social media platforms, online shopping websites, and school portals. 
        One of the most important things I learned is how websites are built using different technologies and how each of them plays a unique role in making a website work. 
        For example, HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the foundation of every website. 
        It structures the content we see like headings, paragraphs, images, buttons, and many more. 
        Without HTML, a website would have no visible content, just an empty page. 
        I also learned that web development has two major sides: front end and back end. 
        The front end is what users see and interact with in their screen, while the back end deals with data processing and information stored in databases. 
        Understanding this lesson made me appreciate how much hard work and logical thinking is behind even the simplest websites we use daily. 
        Another thing I learned is that web developers need to think about design, usability, and accessibility to make sure everyone can use and enjoy the website easily. 
        This introduction to web development opened my mind to how digital the world is becoming and how learning this skill can help us create solutions and platforms that can improve people's daily lives. 
        It also encouraged me to become more curious and eager to explore further, especially when it comes to building my own web projects in the future. 
        Overall, this lesson taught me the importance of learning the basics first because they serve as the strong foundation of all modern websites today.

    During the lesson, we also focused on the basic HTML tags that are necessary to structure a webpage properly. 
    One of these essential tags is the heading tag (h1 to h6), which is used to create titles and subtitles on a webpage. 
    I understood that headings help organize content and make the website easier to read for users and search engines.
    The biggest heading is h1, usually used for the main title, while the smaller headings like h2, h3, and so on are used for section titles.
    Another important tag is the paragraph tag (p). 
    This tag is used to write blocks of text, such as sentences and descriptions, neatly in the webpage. 
    Without paragraphs, the content would look messy and hard to understand.
    I also learned how to use the break tag (br), which allows a line break without starting a new paragraph.
    It is helpful for spacing text and making content more readable. 
    By practicing these tags, I realized that writing HTML feels like giving instructions or commands to the browser on how to display the content.
    The code may seem simple, but every tag has a purpose and must be placed correctly to avoid errors in the webpage layout. 
    The lesson made me more confident as I learned to create a simple webpage using these basic tags. Just seeing my name, title, or sentences appear on the browser after writing the code made me feel excited and proud. 
    It made me believe that I can learn more advanced coding in the future. 
    Understanding these basic tags is like learning the alphabet before writing a story. 
    Knowing them gives me the ability to organize and build a clean and structured webpage step by step.

   After learning the foundation of HTML, I started imagining what kind of website I want to create in the future. One idea that inspires me is to create a personal portfolio website where I can showcase my skills, school projects, achievements, and even my dreams as a student wanting to become a web developer someday. 
   This website would help me introduce myself to the world creatively and professionally.
   I want the homepage to have a welcoming title using a heading tag and a short description about who I am placed inside a paragraph tag. 
  I also want to add a section for my artworks, activities, and certificates to represent the things I have accomplished.
   Another helpful page would be a simple blog section where I can share my learning journey and reflect on new topics about technology.
  I believe this website can grow as I gain more knowledge about CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. 
  Right now, even if my skills are still basic, I feel motivated to continue practicing and improving step by step. 
  Learning HTML made me realize that building a website is like building a house. 
   First, you need a strong foundation, which is what these basic tags provide. In the future, I want to explore more features such as animations, buttons, forms, and even login systems. Creating my own website would not only be a school requirement but something that can represent who I am and what I want to become. I am excited and grateful because this lesson showed me that web development is not just coding, but also creativity, problem solving, and endless possibilities for the websites I want to build.
